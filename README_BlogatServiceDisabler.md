## How It Works

1. **At Boot**: The LaunchAgent automatically loads and runs the script
2. **Every 5 Minutes**: The script re-runs to catch any services that may have re-enabled
3. **Comprehensive Logging**: All actions are logged with timestamps
4. **Multi-User Support**: Works with multiple logged-in users
5. **Persistent**: Services remain disabled even after system updates

## Last Run Summary
- **Services Successfully Disabled**: 64 (32 services × 2 contexts)
- **Services Failed**: 0
- **Essential Services Preserved**: 2
- **Status**: ✅ All bloat services permanently disabled

## Security & Privacy Benefits

- Stops unwanted cloud synchronization
- Disables AI/ML data collection
- Reduces system resource usage
- Enhances privacy by stopping background data transmission

The system is now fully automated and will maintain a clean, debloated macOS environment permanently.
