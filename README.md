Is your Mac slower than it should be, heating up, or losing battery life too fast? You might be running dozens of hidden background processes‚Äîlike Apple Intelligence and Spotlight AI‚Äîthat eat up your resources even if you never use them.

This tool automatically disables 29+ unnecessary user services and background processes in macOS Tahoe 26.0, freeing up your Mac to be faster, quieter, and more private‚Äîwhile keeping everything you actually use, like **AirDrop, Mail, Exchange sync, and device location**.

## üöÄ How does it help?

- **Saves battery and memory** - Stops resource-hungry processes you don't need
- **Makes your Mac faster** - Frees up CPU for everyday work and creative tasks
- **Protects your privacy** - Disables analytics and telemetry collection
- **Easy to install and undo** - Simple setup with full restoration option

## üéØ What This Tool Targets

This tool specifically disables the biggest resource consumers on macOS Tahoe 26.0:

- **Apple Intelligence services** (new in Tahoe 26.0)
- **Enhanced Spotlight indexing** with aggressive AI features
- **Cloud sync services** that constantly run in background
- **Analytics and telemetry** collection services
- **Media analysis** and processing daemons
- **29+ user-level services** (system services require manual execution)

## üì¶ Components

### 1. **Bloat Service Disabler** (`disable_bloat_services.sh`)
- Disables 29+ unnecessary user services and processes
- Runs continuously (60s system-wide, 5min user-specific)
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Preserves Apple Mail sync services
- **NEW**: System update protection - won't interfere with updates
- Targets highest CPU consumers first

### 2. **Cache Cleanup Utility** (`cleanup_caches.sh`)
- Separate utility for cleaning system caches
- Removes Apple Intelligence cache files
- Cleans Spotlight, analytics, and media caches
- Can be run manually or scheduled independently

### 3. **Installation System** (`install.sh`)
- Automated installation with proper permissions
- Creates LaunchDaemons and LaunchAgents
- Includes uninstaller for easy removal
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

## üéØ Priority Targets
