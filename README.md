Is your Mac slower than it should be, heating up, or losing battery life too fast? You might be running dozens of hidden background processes‚Äîlike Apple Intelligence and Spotlight AI‚Äîthat eat up your resources even if you never use them.

This tool automatically disables over 60 unnecessary system services and background apps in macOS Tahoe 26.0, freeing up your Mac to be faster, quieter, and more private‚Äîwhile keeping everything you actually use, like AirDrop, Mail, and device location.

## üöÄ How does it help?

- **Saves battery and memory** - Stops resource-hungry processes you don't need
- **Makes your Mac faster** - Frees up CPU for everyday work and creative tasks
- **Protects your privacy** - Disables analytics and telemetry collection
- **Easy to install and undo** - Simple setup with full restoration option

## üéØ What This Tool Targets

This tool specifically disables the biggest resource consumers on macOS Tahoe 26.0:

- **Apple Intelligence services** (new in Tahoe 26.0)
- **Enhanced Spotlight indexing** with aggressive AI features
- **Cloud sync services** that constantly run in background
- **Analytics and telemetry** collection services
- **Media analysis** and processing daemons
- **60+ unnecessary background processes**

## üì¶ Components

### 1. **Bloat Service Disabler** (`disable_bloat_services.sh`)
- Disables 60+ unnecessary services and processes
- Runs continuously (60s system-wide, 5min user-specific)
- Preserves essential services (AirDrop, Mail, Find My)
- Targets highest CPU consumers first

### 2. **Cache Cleanup Utility** (`cleanup_caches.sh`)
- Separate utility for cleaning system caches
- Removes Apple Intelligence cache files
- Cleans Spotlight, analytics, and media caches
- Can be run manually or scheduled independently

### 3. **Installation System** (`install.sh`)
- Automated installation with proper permissions
- Creates LaunchDaemons and LaunchAgents
- Includes uninstaller for easy removal
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

## üéØ Priority Targets

### High CPU/Memory Consumers
- `mds_stores` - Spotlight metadata (can use 60%+ CPU)
- `mobileassetd` - System update daemon
- `homeenergyd` - Energy monitoring (high CPU)
- `dasd` - AI prediction scheduler
- `mediaanalysisd` - Media analysis (heavy CPU/RAM)

### Apple Intelligence (New in Tahoe 26.0)
- `intelligenceplatformd` - AI platform daemon
- `TGOnDeviceInferenceProviderService` - On-device AI inference
- `knowledgeconstructiond` - Knowledge construction
- `privatecloudcomputed` - Private cloud compute

### Enhanced Spotlight Services

## üîß Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)
```bash
# Download and run installation script
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manooll/Lean_Mac/main/install.sh -o install.sh
sudo bash install.sh
```

### Manual Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/manooll/Lean_Mac.git
cd macos-bloat-disabler
```

2. Run the installer:
```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

### What Gets Installed
- **Main script**: `/usr/local/bin/disable_bloat_services.sh`
- **Cache cleaner**: `/usr/local/bin/cleanup_caches.sh`
- **System daemon**: `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.user.disablebloatservices.plist`
- **User agent**: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.disablebloatservices.agent.plist`
- **Uninstaller**: `/usr/local/bin/uninstall_bloat_disabler.sh`

## üìã Usage

### Automated Operation
After installation, the system runs automatically:
- **System-wide**: Every 60 seconds (high-priority targets)
- **User-specific**: Every 300 seconds (5 minutes)

### Manual Commands
```bash
# Run bloat service disabler
sudo disable_bloat_services.sh

# Clean system caches
sudo cleanup_caches.sh

# Uninstall completely
sudo uninstall_bloat_disabler.sh
```

### Service Management
```bash
# Check service status
sudo launchctl list | grep disablebloatservices
launchctl list | grep disablebloatservices

# Manually load/unload services
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.user.disablebloatservices.plist
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.user.disablebloatservices.plist
```

## üìä Performance Impact

### Expected Resource Savings
- **CPU Usage**: 20-40% reduction in background CPU usage
- **Memory Usage**: 500MB-1GB RAM freed up
- **Disk I/O**: Significantly reduced background disk activity
- **Battery Life**: Improved battery life on laptops

### Monitoring
Check logs to see what's being disabled:
```bash
# System log
tail -f /var/log/disable_bloat_services.log

# User log
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/disable_bloat_services.log

# Cache cleanup log
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/cache_cleanup.log
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Services Keep Re-enabling
```bash
# Check if system updates are re-enabling services

```

#### High CPU Usage Persists
```bash
# Check what's still running
top -o cpu | head -20
```

#### Log File Issues
```bash
# Reset log permissions
sudo chown $(whoami):staff ~/Library/Logs/disable_bloat_services.log
```
