[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-2.0-orange)](https://github.com/your-repo/macos-bloat-disabler/releases)

A comprehensive system optimization tool for macOS Tahoe 26.0 that disables unnecessary background services and processes while preserving essential system functionality.

## üöÄ What This Tool Does

This tool targets the biggest resource consumers on macOS Tahoe 26.0, including:

- **Apple Intelligence services** (new in Tahoe 26.0)
- **Enhanced Spotlight indexing** with aggressive AI features
- **Cloud sync services** that constantly run in background
- **Analytics and telemetry** collection services
- **Media analysis** and processing daemons
- **60+ unnecessary background processes**

## üì¶ Components

### 1. **Bloat Service Disabler** (`disable_bloat_services.sh`)
- Disables 60+ unnecessary services and processes
- Runs continuously (60s system-wide, 5min user-specific)
- Preserves essential services (AirDrop, Mail, Find My)
- Targets highest CPU consumers first

### 2. **Cache Cleanup Utility** (`cleanup_caches.sh`)
- Separate utility for cleaning system caches
- Removes Apple Intelligence cache files
- Cleans Spotlight, analytics, and media caches
- Can be run manually or scheduled independently

### 3. **Installation System** (`install.sh`)
- Automated installation with proper permissions
- Creates LaunchDaemons and LaunchAgents
- Includes uninstaller for easy removal
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

## üéØ Priority Targets

### High CPU/Memory Consumers
- `mds_stores` - Spotlight metadata (can use 60%+ CPU)
- `mobileassetd` - System update daemon
- `homeenergyd` - Energy monitoring (high CPU)
- `dasd` - AI prediction scheduler
- `mediaanalysisd` - Media analysis (heavy CPU/RAM)

### Apple Intelligence (New in Tahoe 26.0)
- `intelligenceplatformd` - AI platform daemon
- `TGOnDeviceInferenceProviderService` - On-device AI inference
- `knowledgeconstructiond` - Knowledge construction
- `privatecloudcomputed` - Private cloud compute

### Enhanced Spotlight Services
- `corespotlightd` - Core spotlight with AI
- `spotlightknowledged` - Knowledge-based search
- Multiple `mdworker` processes

## üîß Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)
```bash
# Download and run installation script
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/manooll/Lean_Mac/main/install.sh -o install.sh
sudo bash install.sh
```

### Manual Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/manooll/Lean_Mac.git
cd macos-bloat-disabler
```

2. Run the installer:
```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

### What Gets Installed
- **Main script**: `/usr/local/bin/disable_bloat_services.sh`
- **Cache cleaner**: `/usr/local/bin/cleanup_caches.sh`
- **System daemon**: `/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.user.disablebloatservices.plist`
- **User agent**: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.disablebloatservices.agent.plist`
- **Uninstaller**: `/usr/local/bin/uninstall_bloat_disabler.sh`

## üìã Usage

### Automated Operation
After installation, the system runs automatically:
- **System-wide**: Every 60 seconds (high-priority targets)
- **User-specific**: Every 300 seconds (5 minutes)

### Manual Commands
```bash
# Run bloat service disabler
sudo disable_bloat_services.sh

# Clean system caches
sudo cleanup_caches.sh

# Uninstall completely
sudo uninstall_bloat_disabler.sh
```

### Service Management
```bash
# Check service status
sudo launchctl list | grep disablebloatservices
launchctl list | grep disablebloatservices

# Manually load/unload services
sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.user.disablebloatservices.plist
sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.user.disablebloatservices.plist
```

## üìä Performance Impact

### Expected Resource Savings
- **CPU Usage**: 20-40% reduction in background CPU usage
- **Memory Usage**: 500MB-1GB RAM freed up
- **Disk I/O**: Significantly reduced background disk activity
- **Battery Life**: Improved battery life on laptops

### Monitoring
Check logs to see what's being disabled:
```bash
# System log
tail -f /var/log/disable_bloat_services.log

# User log
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/disable_bloat_services.log

# Cache cleanup log
tail -f ~/Library/Logs/cache_cleanup.log
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Preserved Essential Services
- **AirDrop/Sharing**: `com.apple.sharingd`
- **Mail**: Apple Mail functionality preserved
- **Find My**: Device location services preserved
- **Exchange Sync**: Enterprise email sync preserved

### Safe Operation
- Non-destructive: Only disables services, doesn't delete files
- Reversible: Includes complete uninstaller
- Logged: All actions are logged for review
- Tested: Extensively tested on macOS Tahoe 26.0

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Before Installation
- **Create a backup** of your system or create a restore point
- **Review the script** to understand what services will be disabled
- **Test on a non-critical system** first if possible

### After Installation
- **Monitor system behavior** for any issues
- **Check logs regularly** for any errors
- **System restart recommended** for full effect
- **Some services may re-enable** after system updates

### Compatibility
- Designed specifically for **macOS Tahoe 26.0**
- May work on earlier versions but not guaranteed
- **Apple Silicon and Intel Macs** both supported

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Services Keep Re-enabling
```bash
# Check if system updates are re-enabling services
sudo launchctl list | grep -E "(intelligence|spotlight|cloud)"
```

#### High CPU Usage Persists
```bash
# Check what's still running
top -o cpu | head -20
```

#### Log File Issues
```bash
# Reset log permissions
sudo chown $(whoami):staff ~/Library/Logs/disable_bloat_services.log
```
